## 📖 About This Project
This is a **demo version** of an Intruder Detection System designed to simulate how motion or intrusion can be detected in a secure area.  
It is not a full production system but serves as a **concept project** to demonstrate security monitoring and alert logic.

👉 **Note:** This is a demo project. If you’d like a **fully functional and complete Intruder Detection System**, feel free to contact me.
